# aurora-asset-downloader
This little program allows you to automatically download covers for all your Aurora Dashboard games, automatically, all at once. It is basically the same thing that Aurora does when you conect it to the internet but without risking a Live ban if you are using ABadUpdate! All covers come from the XboxUnity site.

## Usage
1. Plug your Xbox360 HDD/USB with aurora. (I'm using an external HDD)
2. Run the program, passing the root directory of Aurora (where the aurora.xex file is, and folders like User/, Content/, Plugins/ etc) Example in my case: `aurora-asset-downloader /media/graziano/0FCA-7879/AuroraDashboard`
3. The program will automatically detect which games you have, and based on file size, which covers are you missing, then it will download them one by one.
4. After it finishes, plug the device into your Xbox and boot aurora, go to Settings->Assets and click the `Import` button.
5. Enjoy!
